Chrome/chromium extension that will, on each web page you visit look for adwords advertisement and if target page is from Croatia (.hr domain extension) will automatically click on it.


Why
---

Have you ever been annoyed by pesty adwords adds, no not by their existence or appearance but the content they present? Something like those nasty corrupted political parties advertisements in Croatia. Wouldn't it be nice if you could ignore them?

Well, lets get back to the ground, they are unavoidable, if you live in similar country you just can't runaway from political sewerage (yes, it just keeps flowing). The saddest part is when  you know that your tax money, during election campaigns is spent on advertisements rather than, for eg. fixing road holes in place you live.

On the other hand, why not get some benefits out of money thrown on taxes (I mean, their Croatian version) and give some of it to companies, like Google, that you could actually benefit from?

So, idea of application that will, in background while you browsing, automatically click on those horrifying political advertisements, not just once but producing the stream of clicks. Regardless to payment model, more clicks, in the long run will mean more expenses to political parties and is there a better way for expressing your support to unwanted pests than by giving them unnecessary expenses.
